Today I was doing quick coding in JavaScript, working on my Summer side project you can view here: [[https://benjamminhansen.github.io/Portfolio/#outline-container-org2df7e47][Automate Summer Workflow]].
It was all going fairly well until I created a whole block of code I understood logically would work (or should, because it made
since to me) but it didn't. It would work on the first loop, and then not on any of the others. I was so confused. I displayed some
outputs, pondered what might be affecting the error given the message I was receiving. I made some minor changes, and still - the same bug prevailed.

So, I had to get in to the nitty-gritty and *comment every single line*. After commenting thoroughly each little
piece of the block, I got down to almost the last little bit without any idea what might have been wrong and found the bug.
I thought, what is this doing here? How did it still run once and then quit. It was very weird. After deleting that extra unneeded stuff, it worked.
