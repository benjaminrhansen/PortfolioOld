Today I was doing quick coding in JavaScript, working on my Summer side project you can view here: [[https://benjamminhansen.github.io/Portfolio/#outline-container-org2df7e47][Automate Summer Workflow]].
It was all going fairly well until I created a whole block of code I understood logically would work (or should, because it made
since to me) but it didn't. It would work on the first loop, and then not on any of the others. I was so confused. I displayed some
outputs, pondered what might be affecting the error given the message I was receiving. I made some minor changes, and still - the same bug prevailed.

So, I had to get in to the nitty-gritty and *comment every single line*. After commenting thoroughly each little
piece of the block, I got down to almost the last little bit without any idea what might have been wrong and found the bug.
I thought, what is this doing here? How did it still run once and then quit. It was very weird. After deleting that extra unneeded stuff, it worked.

* How To Install the Source Code Pro Fonts                                       :no_export:
  Simplified from the https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro source:

  Download and unzip [[https://rickneff.github.io/source-code-pro-true-type-font-files-plus-windows-installer.zip][this .zip file]]:

** MacOs
   Use the Font Book app, and Add Fonts from the folder created by unzipping.

** Linux
   You\rsquo{}re on your own for which program to use, but having that program read the
   .ttf files (that you unzipped) will probably work.

** Windows
   Use the files you unzipped. Here are the instructions extracted from
   [[https://rickneff.github.io/fontreg-2.1.3-redist.zip]]:

   If you...

   ...run FontReg.exe without any command-line switches:

  + FontReg will remove any stale font registrations in the registry.
  + FontReg will repair any missing font registrations for fonts located in
    the C:\Windows\Fonts directory (this step will be skipped for .fon fonts if
    FontReg cannot determine which fonts should have "hidden" registrations).

  ...run FontReg.exe with the /copy or /move switch:

  + FontReg will install all files with a .fon, .ttf, .ttc, or .otf file
    extension located in the CURRENT DIRECTORY (which might not necessarily be
    the directory in which FontReg is located).  Installation will entail
    copying/moving the files to C:\Windows\Fonts and then registering the fonts.
  + FontReg will remove any stale font registrations in the registry.
  + FontReg will repair any missing font registrations for fonts located in
    the C:\Windows\Fonts directory (this step will be skipped for .fon fonts if
    FontReg cannot determine which fonts should have "hidden" registrations).

  FontReg.exe is intended as a replacement for Microsoft's outdated fontinst.exe,
  and like fontinst.exe, FontReg.exe is fully silent--it will not print messages,
  pop up dialogs, etc.; the process exit code will be 0 if there was no error.
